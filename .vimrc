Explanation: Throughout this lab, the main idea was to create a vimrc file that altered some colors. To do this, I needed to go into the terminal and use the 'vim .vimrc' command to create a new vimrc file. After this, I had input the text below into the file. To quit, I had to first save the file using :w (write) and then :q for quit. After this, I had to copy (using cp) the file while renaming it to the desktop. Then I had to write this explanation, save it again, then copy it again.
